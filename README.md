# todo

- Describe the models in go
- Use the AST to get hold of the models, structure ...
- Write out the templates to generate a starter for redux 
- Write out the templates to generate starter for each api crud 
- Write out the templates to generate redux slice

This is the what we want to achieve with the code gen, but we will not focus on building it all at once. That would derail us. Mainly because none of the concept is concrete.

So instead we will do it on a as need basis."# learn-go-code-generation"
